## <div id="installation">üíª Installation
Before installing Cortex, ensure that the required packages are present for the application to run. Use the following command to install these required packages:
```bash
apt install wget gnupg apt-transport-https git ca-certificates ca-certificates-java curl  software-properties-common python3-pip lsb_release
```
<br>

### Java
```bash
apt install -y openjdk-11-jre-headless
echo JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64" >> /etc/environment
export JAVA_HOME="/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64"
```
<br>

### Elasticsearch 
```bash
wget -qO - https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch |  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/elasticsearch-keyring.gpg] https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/7.x/apt stable main" |  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/elastic-7.x.list 
sudo apt install elasticsearch
```
<br>

### Cortex
```bash
wget -O- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex/master/PGP-PUBLIC-KEY"  | sudo apt-key add -
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex/master/PGP-PUBLIC-KEY |  sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/thehive-project.gpg
echo 'deb https://deb.thehive-project.org release main' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/thehive-project.list
apt install cortex
```
<br><br>

## <div id="configurations">‚öôÔ∏è Configurations
### Elasticsearch
To enable Cortex to connect to Elasticsearch services, you must configure Elasticsearch to run on your localhost. Modify the configuration file located at `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml` with the following changes:
```yml
http.host: 127.0.0.1
transport.host: 127.0.0.1
cluster.name: hive
thread_pool.search.queue_size: 100000
path.logs: "/var/log/elasticsearch"
path.data: "/var/lib/elasticsearch"
xpack.security.enabled: false
script.allowed_types: "inline,stored"
```
<br>

### Cortex
To establish a connection between Elasticsearch and Cortex, you need to make adjustments to the configuration file located at `/etc/cortex/application.conf`. Follow these changes to the file:
```conf
## ElasticSearch
search {
  # Name of the index
  index = cortex
  # ElasticSearch instance address.
  uri = "http://127.0.0.1:9200"
}
```
<br>

Ensuring that our host stays secure we are also going to change the defualt port that cortex runs over as to not let threat actors know what service we are running. We can do this adding the following line in our `application.conf` file.
```conf
http.port = 8090
```

<br>

### Analyzers & Responders
Analyzers and Responders are at the core of Cortex, enabling us to analyze and respond to the data we input into the system.

Before downloading these modules, Cortex requires specific packages for them to function. Use the following command to install the necessary packages:
```bash
sudo apt install -y --no-install-recommends python3-pip python3-dev ssdeep libfuzzy-dev libfuzzy2 libimage-exiftool-perl libmagic1 build-essential git libssl-dev
sudo pip3 install -U pip setuptools
```
We'll create a directory in our `/opt` directory to store these modules by running the following commands:
```bash
# Move to the /opt directory 
cd /opt

# Download the Analyzers & Responders modules from github 
git clone https://github.com/TheHive-Project/Cortex-Analyzers

# Give permission to cortex to access/read the Cortex-Analyzers directory 
chown -R cortex:cortex /opt/Cortex-Analyzers
```
Now, let's set up each module, each of which is organized in the Cortex-Analyzers directory with its requirements.txt file. Run the following command:
```bash
for I in $(find Cortex-Analyzers -name 'requirements.txt'); do sudo -H pip3 install -r $I || true; done
```
> [!NOTE]
> The download may take a while due to the large volume of modules that need to be installed.
<br>

Finally we need to configure Cortex to pull from the right file path to our Analyzers & Responders in our `/etc/cortex/application.conf` and make the following changes:
```bash
[..]
analyzer {
  urls = [
    "/opt/Cortex-Analyzers/analyzer",
  ]

  fork-join-executor {
    parallelism-min = 2
    parallelism-factor = 2.0
    parallelism-max = 4
  }
}

responder {
  urls = [
    "/opt/Cortex-Analyzers/responders"
  ]

  fork-join-executor {
    parallelism-min = 2
    parallelism-factor = 2.0
    parallelism-max = 4
  }
}
[..]
```
<br><br>

## <div id="startup">üöÄ Startup
Now that we have both Elasticsearch and Cortex installed and configured, we can startup both services.
<br>

### Elasticsearch 
```bash
sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch
```
To verify that Elasticsearch has started without any issues, use the command:
```bash
sudo systemctl status elasticsearch
```
In the event that Elasticsearch fails to start, you can check the logs using:
```bash
journalctl -u elasticsearch -n 100

# Or directory for elastic Log data
cd /var/log/elasticsearch
```
<br>

### Cortex
Now that Elasticsearch is running, we can startup Cortex with the following commands:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable cortex
sudo systemctl start cortex
```
To check if Cortex has started successfully, use the command:
```bash
sudo systemctl status cortex
```
If Cortex fails to start, you can examine the logs using:
```bash
journalctl -u cortex -n 100

# Or directory for cortex Log data
cd /var/log/cortex
```
<br>

### Account setup 
These services may take some time to start up, but once they have initialized completely, you should be able to reach the Cortex site at `http://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS:8090/`.
There are just a couple more steps we need to complete before everything is ready to use:
1. Open your browser and connect to `http://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS:8090/`
2. When loading the page for the first time, you'll be prompted to Update Database, which will create a database in Elasticsearch that we're using to store all of our data for Cortex.
3. You will be asked to then create your first Cortex user, which will be your global administrator account.
4. Now that we are logged into our global administrator account, we can create our first organization by clicking the ***Add Organization*** button.
5. Within your organization, we need to create our first user by clicking the Add User button. Ensure to set Roles to ***Read, Analyze, orgadmin***.
6. Once your first user has been created for your organization, you'll need to reset the password before you can log in. Click the ***New Password*** button to do this.
7. Logout of your global admin account on the top right and sign into your new account that we just made.
<br>

### Analyzers & Responders
Now that we are in our organization that we have just created, we can access our Analyzers & Responders, which you can enable by going to Organization > Analyzers. Listed are all the installed Analyzers & Responders that we can enable as needed.
<br><br>

## Security 
To ensure that our data remain safe & secure we are going to configure traffic to be sent over HTTPS. Cortex shouldn't have a built in function that does this so we are going to use a reverse proxy setup.
We'll be using nginx to setup our reverse proxy with our cortex service to run over HTTPS.
<br>

### Nginx Install
To install nginx, use command:
```bash
sudo apt-get install nginx
```
<br>

### Self-Signed Certificates 
In order for us to generate a certificate and key with a Cerficiatae Authority, we'll be using `openssl`.
<br>

**OpenSSL Install**<br>
```bash
sudo apt-get install openssl
```
<br>

**Generate Certificates**
1. First we'll make a directory to store our certificates in.
  ```bash
  mkdir /etc/nginx/sites-available/certs

  # Change permissiont to give nginx access to the folder and files in it
  chown -R www-data:www-data ./certs
  ```
2. First we need a to generate a private key which you can do by running the command:
  ```bash
  openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out certificate.key
  ```
3. Generate a certificate signing request (CSR).
  ```bash
  openssl req -new -key certificate.key -out certificate.csr
  ```
4. Generate a Self-Signed Certificate.
  ```bash
  openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in certificate.csr -signkey certificate.key -out certificate.crt
  ```
<br>

## Nginx Configuration
1. Change to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory and create a file `cortex.conf` with the following code inside:
  ```conf
  server {
      listen 443 ssl http2;
      server_name cortex;
  
      #Change with path to your certificates
      ssl_certificate     /etc/nginx/sites-available/certs/certificate.crt; 
      ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/sites-available/certs/certificate.key;
  
      ssl_protocols       TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
      ssl_ciphers         'TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256:TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384:TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384';
  
      ssl_prefer_server_ciphers off;
      ssl_session_timeout 1d;
      ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:50m;
  
      # Enable OCSP stapling
      ssl_stapling on;
      ssl_stapling_verify on;
  
      # Set the resolver to a DNS server that supports OCSP stapling (e.g., Google's public DNS)
      resolver 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 valid=300s;
      resolver_timeout 5s;
  
      proxy_connect_timeout   600;
      proxy_send_timeout      600;
      proxy_read_timeout      600;
      send_timeout            600;
      client_max_body_size    2G;
      proxy_buffering off;
      client_header_buffer_size 8k;
  
      location / {
          add_header              Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains";
          proxy_pass              http://127.0.0.1:8090/;
          proxy_http_version      1.1;
          proxy_set_header        Upgrade $http_upgrade;
          proxy_set_header        Connection 'upgrade';
          proxy_set_header        Host $host;
          proxy_cache_bypass      $http_upgrade;
      }
  }
  ```
2. Ensure that you give permissions to cortex access/run the file.
  ```bash
  chown -R www-data:www-data ./cortex.conf
  ```
3. Navigate to the `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` directory so that we can Create a symbolic link to our cortex.conf file so that cortex knows what to run:
  ```bash
  sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/cortex.conf cortex
  ```
4. Remove the following files to remove the defualt nginx page:
  ```bash
  rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/defualt
  rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/defualt
  ```
5. Ensure that our next `./cortex.conf` can run with the following command to test the configurations with nginx:
  ```bash
  sudo nginx -t
  ```
6. Reload nginx to apply the changes we have made.
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl reload nginx
  ```
7. Cortex should now be accessable on `https://YOUR_SERVER_ADDRESS`

### Close port 8090 
As we now have our reverse proxy setup to redirect cortex through port 443 for secure encryption, port 8090 is still open. To ensure we leave no unnecessary ports open we are going to add a rule to our internal Iptable on our ubuntu host to redirect all traffic from *:8090 to 127.0.0.1:8090. This will ensure that our reverse proxy will still function, while at the same time no users can access cortex through port 8090.
Use the following command to make the necessary changes to your IPTable:
```bash
# Allow loopback interface
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

# Allow incoming connections to port 8090 from localhost
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8090 -s 127.0.0.1 -j ACCEPT

# Drop all other incoming connections to port 8090
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 8090 -j DROP
```
To save these changes that we have made so that on reboot they are not lost, use command:
```bash
# Save the rules
sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules"

# Restore the rules during startup
sudo sh -c "iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules"
```
