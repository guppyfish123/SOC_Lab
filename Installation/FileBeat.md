In this lab, we'll leverage Filebeat version 8.11. Refer to the official [Filebeat documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/filebeat-installation-configuration.html) for comprehensive installation and configuration details.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure consistency by using the same version of Filebeat as your Elasticsearch and Kibana on the other host.

## Introduction
In this part of the lab, we'll set up a host running a default Apache website with Filebeat installed. This host will seamlessly connect to our Kibana and Elasticsearch instances, becoming the conduit for capturing real-world traffic from the public internet.

This process allows us to feed valuable data into our Elastic SIEM, providing a practical and hands-on experience in the realm of security operations.
