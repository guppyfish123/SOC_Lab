## <div id="installation">üíª Installation
Make sure your host is up to date by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt upgrade -y
```
<br>

Now that your host is up to date, proceed to install MISP by downloading the installation script:

```bash
wget --no-cache -O /tmp/INSTALL.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MISP/MISP/2.4/INSTALL/INSTALL.sh
```
<br>

MISP provides an installation script that automates the process and downloads all required packages. Execute the following commands to run the script:
```bash
# Running this command will tell us the download options
bash /tmp/INSTALL.sh

# We'll be using the -A parameter to download all modules and packages for MISP
bash /tmp/INSTALL.sh -A
```
> [!NOTE]
> The installation process may take some time as it involves the installation of several dozen packages. There are a couple of manual interventions required, but the script handles most of the work to install MISP.
