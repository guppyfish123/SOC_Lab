# SOC_Lab

This DIY project utilizes a range of free open source resources including Elastic, Kibana, Fleet, MISP, Cortex, The Hive, Shuffle, and AWS. The goal of his lab is to provide you with a comprehensive hands-on experience in managing a production-like environment, seamlessly integrating a SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response), and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) for optimal cybersecurity practices.


## Key Components
In the SOC Lab, we leverage a carefully selected set of free and open-source tools to empower your security operations. Here's an overview of the key components driving this lab:
